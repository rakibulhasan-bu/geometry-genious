        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium pb-2">What is event bubble?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM. It's means that when an
          element receives an event, and that event bubbles up to its parent and
          ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.
          If we wanna stop this bubbling that use event.stopPropagation() in the
          section what we wanna stop.

          What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          JavaScript callback function that is passed as an argument to another
          function so that it can be executed in that other function is called
          as a callback function. Callback functions are needed because many
          JavaScript actions are asynchronous. it executes in the background
          while the rest of the code runs.when we use event then we use callback
          function because we want to when event fire then use function
